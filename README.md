# Modeling-Some-Domains

This repository contains logic models created using the **Database Markup Language (DBML)**. DBML is a simple, readable DSL language designed to define and document database structures.

## Features
- **Editable Source Code**: The `.dbml` source files can be easily edited to reflect any changes in the database schema.
- **Visualization**: With the help of [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/), these DBML files can be visualized as clear and concise diagrams, making it easier to understand the relationships and structure of the database.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to get access to the `.dbml` files.
2. Make any necessary modifications to the DBML files as per your domain modeling needs.
3. Visit [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/) and upload your `.dbml` file to visualize the database structure.


PS: Scripts .sql in this repository are designed to be compatible with Microsoft SQL Server.

Feel free to contribute or suggest improvements to the models!
